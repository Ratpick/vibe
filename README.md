# Hexagram One – Mythopoetic Teaser Node

Originally developed as a hidden narrative seed for the Gamma-built prototype site, this standalone HTML/CSS/JS project is a symbolic “easter egg” that blossoms into a rich audiovisual meditation on Hexagram One: The Creative.

## Intent

- To serve as an interactive myth-node within the Simulacrum Model.
- To test ambient audio, sequential poetic narrative delivery, and symbolic UI/UX for future Constellation Views.
- To remain light and self-contained, suitable for GitHub Pages deployment or iframe embedding.

## Features

- **Looping Tibetan overtone audio** with volume controls.
- **Hexagramic myth sequence**, slowly unfolding line by line.
- Stylised **background imagery** and **text animations**.
- Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for maximum portability.

## Future Integrations

- Plug into `/frontend/hexagram-myth/` under the `simulacrum-engine` monorepo.
- Fetch text dynamically from JSON for future extensibility.
- Link outward to dynamic constellation views, oracle interactions, and lore docs.
